## TODO

* Create all four color palettes.

  + Use these colors for a color palette: https://www.dwitter.net/d/5455

* Create an automated customization flow.

* Effects/filter ideas:

  + Check https://github.com/gskinnerTeam/flutter_vignettes/tree/master/vignettes/indie_3d for the blending effect.

  + Add some texture over components, e.g.</a> metal-like, wood-like, or just w/e looks interesting.

* Reconsider ball.

  + https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/physics/physics-library.html

* Consider if reversing to zero for the weather icon loops is really the right thing to do.

<hr>

* Check rules and FAQ: https://flutter.dev/clock

* TODOs.

* Remove unnecessary depencies and other stuff. For example, `pedantic` or `uses-material-design` if there are no icons in the final design.

* Format code and follow all other steps decribed [here](https://flutter.dev/clock#submissions).

* Use `master` branch when recording the videos.

* Add GIF to README.

* Publish repository.

* Make clock available on web via GitHub pages.

  + Deploy transpiled web version to `gh-pages` branch.

    - Use `master` branch.

  + Watch "Designing for the Web with Flutter" from Flutter Interact for this.

  + Update link further down.

* Confirm that submission runs on `stable` ([Getting Started, 6.](https://flutter.dev/clock))

* Submit submission :)

* Create issue for the shadow issue caused by the slide and `CompositedClock._transformedPaint` .

<hr>

* Write article about the creation process of the submission on Flutter Community.

  + Ideally go into details regarding the different stages of the process providing images and maybe snapshots by linking to a particular commit on GitHub.

  + Share some of the technical details that make this submission special apart from what can be seen looking at it.

    - For example: what kinds of `RenderObject` s were used and information about `Canvas` and BÃ©zier curves (the simple quadratic and cubic ones `Canvas` offers).

    - Mention that people can, if they are interested in doing custom layouts but `MultiChildRenderObjectWidget` seems too complicated for them, check out https://stackoverflow.com/a/59483482/6509751 to get started with `CustomMultiChildLayout` .

  + Consider embedding some visualizations made by https://debugger.skia.org/.

    - Make sure to replace all `Paint.shader` properties by solid colors when taking the screenshots because the debugger seems to not be able to render shaders (https://stackoverflow.com/q/59589892/6509751).

    - Capture using `flutter screenshot --type=skia --observatory-uri=..` .

  + Mention `RenderObject.isRepaintBoundary` for performance optimizations (did not use raster caching) and `RepaintBoundary` for widgets.

    - Show illustrations with the **repaint rainbow** enabled.

  + Can also play with commenting components out from the paint order.

  + Add an "Everything is implicitly animated" screen recording, where the model values are modified programmatically.

  + Mention that usually accessibility and with that semantics are taken care of by prebuilt widgets, but for this clock face it was necessary to do it manually, i.e.</a> override [ `RenderObject.describeSemanticsConfiguration` ](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/describeSemanticsConfiguration.html) .

    - Show the semantics view.

  + Show every (major) component by itself.

  + Add link to it to README.

    - Update the link further down.

  + Potentially post it on https://dev.to/.

  + Share on FlutterDev: Twitter, Reddit, and Discord.

    - Tweet be like "Can you create a #FlutterClock face with animations without using Flare/Rive? I have done exactly that.."

# clock | [View demo](https://creativecreatorormaybenot.github.io/clock) | [Read article](https://medium.com/@creativecreatorormaybenot) (coming soon) | [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/creativemaybeno?label=Follow%20me&style=social)](https://twitter.com/creativemaybeno)

[creativecreatorormaybenot](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot)'s entry to the [Flutter clock challenge](https://flutter.dev/clock).
This is a playful clock display and uses exclusively the Flutter `Canvas` to draw everything you see on screen. That means that there are no assets, plugins, and not even prebuilt widgets used, i.e.</a> every `RenderObject` in the tree was custom made by me.

![Quick screen capture showing the final result of the submission](capture.gif)

The code entry point for the clock face is [ `canvas_clock/lib/main.dart` ](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/clock/blob/master/canvas_clock/lib/main.dart).

## Notes

I was inspired by the design of an old analog barometer and hygrometer kind of device initially and took many design ideas away from that. Later on, many other inspirations came my way :)

You can follow my whole process of building the clock face in this repository, i.e.</a> every bit of it. Maybe it helps someone :)  
Additionally, I wrote a whole article about the technical implementation of my submission.</a> [Read it here](https://medium.com/@creativecreatorormaybenot).

### Web version

* You can view the clock face running on Flutter web [here](https://creativecreatorormaybenot.github.io/clock).

* **Notice**: some features are not supported on web, e.g.</a> some of the weather icon animations because trimming paths does not yet work in Flutter web. Same goes for some of the shaders, which are also still *unimplemented*. The sections in code have documentation or comments that link to [Flutter GitHub issues](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues) discussing these problems.

* Apart from unsupported features, the web version looks slightly different in general because some features of the framework are currently implemented differently in Flutter web.

### Implementation

* No plugins were used at all (check [ `pubspec.yaml` ](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/clock/blob/master/canvas_clock/pubspec.yaml)).

* No premade widgets from the standard library were used in my own code, i.e.</a> every `RenderObject` in the tree of the clock was custom created by me.

  + Accessibility was implemented customly and it had to because I did not use any prebuilt widgets that come with `Semantics` implementations. Instead I overrode [ `RenderObject.describeSemanticsConfiguration` ](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/rendering/RenderObject/describeSemanticsConfiguration.html) for every component with semantic relevance.

* No assets were used. The bullet point would be a bit short without this second sentence.

* I did not go with the raw layer (here is an [old demonstration](https://github.com/creativecreatorormaybenot/pong) of the Flutter raw layer I did) nor the rendering layer.<br>This was not compatible with the `ClockCustomizer` and is also not convenient for working with data at all. The Flutter trees are pretty neat, so we should use them (they make the app reactive) :)

### Hand bouncing

* For the animation of the second hand (and minute hand) bouncing of the analog clock, I enjoyed looking at this [slow motion capture of a watch](https://youtu.be/tyl7-gHRBX8?t=29) (the important part is blurry (:, yes).
